# def print_argument(*args):   # similar to list # ["Ria", "Pramod", "Raj"]
#     for i in args:
#         print(i, end=" ")   #end = (/n) or (/t)

# print_argument("Ria", "Pramod", "Raj")


# *args is very similar to -> List. It's nothing but a list

a = ["Pramod", "Amit", "Lucky"]
for i in a:             # yaha "a" ko iterate kar rahe hai. matlab i ki first value Promod hogi. 2nd .. 3rd .. aise
    print(i)

## java me apan aise karte the
# for i in a.length:
#     print(a[i])


# why we didnt take range above.
# >> Range we take usally when we want ot go from 1 to 10 or 100 to 110. Output 1 to 10 me he hoga.
# Range nahi list chahaiye. is liye list he type karo
# But if you want to iterate ove the list, use list not range. in above case is "a".
