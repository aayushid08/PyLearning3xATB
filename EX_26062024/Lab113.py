# OPPS - Object oriented programming
# Objects -> what is object

# procedural programming language: -> FUNCTIONS
# here we have only functions. Create Function and Do the Task
# it does not take care of the attributes and behaviour
# c, basic, fortan  - X


#oops - close to real world
# Opps - class, objects
# class and objects talks about attribute and behaviour
# Python, Java, C#, C++

# Object Oriented Programing is a programing paradigm that uses "object" to design application and computer program

# students -> Attributes , Behaviour
# Attributes / Properties / Data Members
# Behaviour / Methods / Members functions


# attributes: name, id, phone, city, gender
# attribute : by which someone can recognize us

# Behaviour - Walk, talk, write, sing, dance, watch
# you can do something

# Class and Objects:
# Blueprint to create a HUMAN - (its not a real entity)
# This human has some attributes:
# Attributes: 2 eyes, 2 ears, nose, phone, name, address
# Behaviour: Walk, talk, write, sing, dance, watch

# THIS BLUEPRINT IS CALLED CLASS
# Class is just a blueprint to create a object
# Object is the real entity which is created from the class
# Object is the instance of the class

class Human:
    # Attributes
    # Behaviour
    pass

# @ _ @ << this is human1
# Name : Pramod, 2 eyes, 1 nose, address
# walk(), talk(), write(), sing()

# @ _ @ << this is human2
# Name : Ayushi, 2 eyes, 1 nose, address    # make sure we have 2 eyes because class me 2 eyes di hui hai
# walk(), talk(), write(), sing()

# Both of the humans are different
# Both came from the class
# both have different set of behaviour

# Objects takes the space in the memories (Original Building)
# Classes are just the blueprint (Papaer pe drawing banaya hua plan)

# Object is the instance of the class
