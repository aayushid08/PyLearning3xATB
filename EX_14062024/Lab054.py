# A function is a block of code that performs a specific task
# It is a reusable block of code
# It is a good practice to keep your code organized and modular
# Functions can take inputs (parameters) and return outputs
# Functions can be called (invoked) from other parts of the code
# Repeatative task can be done by the function
