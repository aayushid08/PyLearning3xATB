name = "John"

# Comparison Operator ==

# in python 0 is false and anything else or 1 is true

age = +65 # unary operator + ( Pycharm +_ -> Remove , Self exp.
num = -1
print(age)
print(num)

r = age + num # BODMAS -Math
print(r)

# Not Operator (Booleans)
is_adult = True
print(not is_adult)

# Is Opeartor (Booleans) Identity operator
a = 5
b = 6
c = False

print(a is b)
print(a is c)

# is operator is mostly use in list and dictionary
# is operator is not use in string

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list2 = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list is my_list2) # even if the values are same, the address is different so it is false
